    "Here will be presented the step by step process for calculating the neregy profile for rotating the central bond of butane. We have seen that butane has energy minima at torsion angles of 180&deg; and 67&deg;. It also has a maximum at 0&deg;. Is the other maxima at 120&deg; or is it slightly offset due to the size difference between a hydrogen and a methyl group? We will make many input files with locked torsion angles varying fro 0&deg; to 180&deg; and then calculate the optimized structures at each locked angle. The energies will be extracted from the output files and we will then plot the potential energy profile for bond rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Input File\n",
    "\n",
    "First we write an input file for butane. We will not use symmetry because we want to rotate the bond to many different angles. We will use the Z-matrix method because it will identify the central torsion as a coordinate. Then we can lock that coordinate.\n",
