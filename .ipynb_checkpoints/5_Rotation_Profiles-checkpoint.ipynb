    "# Butane: Rotation Energy Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest chemical transformations to model and explore in computational chemistry is conformational changes. We will start with the rotation potential energy profiles. \n",
    "We will now build butane using the build tools in wxMacMolPlt and then submit the data to GAMESS as an optimization calculation via GamessQ.\n",
    "No more symmetry (for now). If we want to rotate molecules around bonds, the symmetry will be changing with the rotation. Do consider that symmetry saved a lot of computational effort and should be considered carefully when using expensive methods. We will downgrade our method for optimizations to HF/3-21G\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will accomplish the following…\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tUse MacMolPlt to build molecules, generate input files and interpret results. \n",
    "2.\tFreeze a coordinate in a series of internal coordinates.\n",
    "3.\tChange the frozen coordinate and obtain the optimized structure an energy within that limitation.\n",
    "4.\tLearn how to use the command-line Unix tools sed and grep to generate a large series of input files with different values for the frozen coordinate and to extract data quickly from large numbers of files. We will submit all these files at once via GamessQ.\n",
    "5.\tWith these methods we will create a rotational energy profile around a given bond in an alkane.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Butane\n",
    "\n",
    "Run MacMolPlt. Click on `Builder` $\\rightarrow$ `Show Build Tools`. Choose carbon atoms and set the coordination number to 4 (four bonds to an sp3 carbon). Then click in the window to build the molecule, A carbon with four connections will appear. Then click on one of the connections to add a new carbon. When you have added all four carbon atoms, change the build tool to hydrogen and then click on the remaining connections to include bonds. In the end you will have a window that looks like this perhaps. \n",

    "### Interpreting The Input File\n",
    "\n",
    "The GAMESS input file starts off with essential settings and information is the `$CONTRL`, `$SYSTEM`, `$BASIS`, `$SCF` and `$STATPT` groups. Each group ends with `$END`. The settings within each group will be discussed where needed as we proceed, and detailed information is found in the GAMESS documentation at https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/GAMESS/\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "All white space must be spaces, not tabs. And all lines that start with a $ symbol must have that $ symbol in the second column, not the first. Examine the above file and observe this fact.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$DATA` group contains the description of the molecule. The first line after the declaration of `$DATA` is the name of the molecule. You can change “Title” to “Butane” in the input builder if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line is the symmetry. We are not using symmetry, so the symmetry point group is declared to be *C<sub>1</sub>* (no symmetry). Using symmetry will greatly reduce the work of the calculation. We will ignore this useful idea for now.\n",
    "The next line begins the description of the molecule. We could use an xyz coordinate system but that is a block of numbers that can be difficult to interpret. We will use internal coordinates that describe each atoms relationship to another atom or atoms. This will make more sense when examined by the human eye and allows for greater control in setting up initial geometries and bond angles. The internal coordinate system that we will use is the Z-matrix\n",

We know the distance from atom #2 to this atom #3, but we also now need a bond angle between atoms #3, 2 and 1. In *sp<sup>3</sup>* carbons that angle is 109.4˚ (120 for *sp<sup>2</sup>* and 180˚ for *sp*).\n",

Three atoms are in a plane, by definition. Distance and angle will locate them all. However, a fourth atom is potentially outside of the plane of the first three. We now will add the angle to that fourth atom relative to the plane of the first three. This is a dihedral angle. In the case of our structure, the angle of the bond between atoms #4 and #1 relative to the plane of atoms #1, 2 and 3 is 180˚. That is the same as saying that the plane described by #1,2,3 is 180˚ relative to the plane described by #4,1,2.\n",

    "Run the GamessQ program. You will get a window. Drag your input file into the window. GamessQ will ask you how many processors to use. Stick with one for now. Your modern computer probably has 4 cores or more so we can always throw more power at the problem but this small calculation won’t need any heavy iron.\n",

    "A detailed discussion of a GAMESS output file is presented in the next section where we repeat this exercise with butadiene. There will also be a discussion of useful Unix tools for making everything that we do here much easier. For now we will do things the hard way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GamessQ program will copy the input file and produce an output file to the folder designated it its preference pane. The file will have a number appended. In our case, the input file was named butane.inp.  The files written are the copy of the input file and the output file: butane_246.inp and butane_246.log. (Yes, I have run 245 jobs already trying to figure out how to use GAMESS.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The log file has thousands of lines of text (assuming it didn’t crash out with an error because I goofed up the input file.) There is ultimately a line that states EXECUTION OF GAMESS TERMINATED NORMALLY. Open the log file and search for the word “normally” in the text. The phrase should appear near the end of the file. If you find the word ABNORMALLY instead, then the run has crashed out. Error information will be in the file to troubleshoot. Crashes are almost always a problem with the input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The run exited in a controlled manner, but that does not mean that things went well. Let us examine the butane_246.log file. Each step of the search for an energy minimum involved calculating the function that describes the energy and then calculating the derivative of that function for each atom. The derivative is the slope. If the slope is zero then we are at a stationary point (either a maximum or minimum) and if the slope has a value then there is a direction downhill. GAMESS will calculate the change for each atom that will follow that gradient. The change will be applied to each atom and the new structure will be recalculated. This will repeat until the total gradient for the molecule has reached a very small value, indicating that we are at the bottom (or top!) of an energy surface. \n",

If a gas of neutral carbon atoms (only 4 electrons in their valence shells – very unhappy) combined with neutral hydrogen atoms (also with unfilled valence shells) then the energy reported by GAMESS is what is released (per molecule).

    "Allowing the structure to relax to minimums at torsional angles of near 180˚ (anti) and 60˚ (gauche) merely requires allowing it to happen. But how do we optimize a structure for a maximum? The syn conformer and the eclipsed conformer are each peaks in energy. We can freeze the value for any of the coordinates in the `$ZMAT` group using the `IFREEZ` setting within the `$STATPT` group.\n",

    "The 6$^{th}$ coordinate in the `$ZMAT` group is for the central C–C bond torsion. If we add the command `IFREEZ(1)=6` then the value of that internal coordinate will not be able to change.  All the other bond lengths, angles and torsions will seek their lowest energy so we will hopefully find the lowest energy versions of the syn and eclipsed conformations.\n",

    "\n",
    "We used MacMolPlt to build a model of butane and export an initial input file for an optimization calculation. We optimized the structure for the anti conformation and found the gauche conformation by starting with an initial structure that was to near that conformation. Thus we located the global minimum and a local minimum on the rotational energy surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we edited the file to freeze the coordinate that corresponded to the central C–C bond rotation and the set the internal coordinate for that torsion to 0˚ and 120˚ to find the energy of the syn conformation and an eclipsed conformation. With this, we have the important parts of the rotational energy profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned how to use Unix tools to extract information from large text files and from multiple text files and we learned how to create multiple input files using an automated process. We were introduced to the idea of shell scripts and to useful tools such as grep and sed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined the format of the Z-matrix in detail. We used the internal coordinates to easily create the series of input files for the rotational coordinate scan. Using Unix tools, we created many input files with frozen torsion coordinates to create a rotational energy profile. We used GamessQ to submit the files as a batch job. We extracted the energy from these files and plotted the complete rotational energy profile.\n",

    "### The Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct ethane, propane, butane, 2-methylbutane using MacMolPlt. Export input files for GAMESS with Z-matrices and using the $ZMAT group for declaring internal coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Identify all likely minima and maxima along the rotational energy surface using the central C–C torsion coordinate of each molecule. Calculate the HF/3-21G energy for optimized structures at these points in the coordinate. Use frozen coordinates (or symmetry) for the energy maxima. Create a table with the energies and torsion angles for all your calculations (relative to the global minimum in each) with units in kJ/mole and degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Unix tools (or brute force) generate input files for rotational energy scans of these molecules. Produce a\n",
    "plot of energy vs. angle to create a visual representation of the rotational energy profile of each molecule. Try placing all four profiles on the same plot for comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Present a ONE PAGE document with the table of angles and energies for maxima and minima that you generated. Include the plot of the entire rotational energy profile and comment if it fits with your table. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you brute forced the operation, please report the time it took to create all the files and extract the energy data from each result file. If you used the Unix tools, please report the time as well. The table and plot must be professional in appearance.\n",
