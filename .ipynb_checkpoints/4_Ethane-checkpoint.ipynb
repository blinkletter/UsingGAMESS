    "# Ethane: Symmetry in Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethane can rotate freely along the C–C bond. The lowest energy conformation is the anti form and the highest energy is the syn form. It is easy to get GAMESS to optimize the anti structure, the software will seek the lowest energy state. How do we get the syn form? We could use ways to lock coordinates but another way is to enforce symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will hopefully accomplish the following goals while learning new skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tWe will manually construct Z-matrices for larger molecules and identify an internal coordinate that defines the torsion angle between the two methyl groups of ethane.\n",
    "2.\tWe will use the symmetry of the anti and syn conformations to lock their conformations\n",
    "3.\tWe will determine optimized structure and the energy difference between the syn and anti-conformations and compare our results to literature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Point Groups in Ethane\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the extreme cases in ethane has symmetry. They have different symmetry and so we can use that to our advantage. The symmetry of the syn conformation is *D<sub>3h</sub>* and for the anti it is *D<sub>3d</sub>*. By declaring the symmetry group, the optimization will start with that symmetry and end with that symmetry. This will enforce the anti conformation for us. Additionally, by symmetry each molecule can be reduce to just two atoms for the purposes of the calculation. Using symmetry when possible will greatly reduce the cost of calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Z-Matrix for Ethane\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start with a Z-matrix for ethane. If the structure described fits the symmetry group declared, then GAMESS will align it appropriately in the xyz coordinate system and identify the symmetry unique atoms. Take note of how the two methyl groups are set up so that they refer to their own atoms as much as possible and there is only one coordinate that describes the bond rotation. Below is the initial input file for the anti conformation with *D<sub>3d</sub>* symmetry.\n",

    "\n",
    "The literature value for the ethane rotational energy barrier is 12.1 kJ/mole.[^Hirota1979]  We were pretty close with what today is considered a low level of theory. There has been lots of recent work in this subject. Despite its simplicity, or because of it, it has been a focus for theoretical investigations. It started with an argument that molecular orbital interactions stabilizing the anti conformation were the more important contributor to the energy difference compared to electronic repulsion in the syn conformation.[^Goodman2001]  This is an idea that has been floated since the 1970’s[^Lowe1973] but it gained new life with the Nature publication. People disagreed and the fight was on.[^Bickelhaupt2004] There are ongoing efforts to further refine the model for the energy difference.[^Baranac2015][^Mo2011]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned more about constructing a Z-matrix and applied this knowledge to design a Z-matrix for ethane within which we can easily create any torsion angle we wish. We have observed how defining symmetry can enforce a given conformation while optimizing a structure. We have observed that the structures and the energy difference were reasonably close to literature values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Repeat the activities described in the discussion but edit the input files to add a command to output data for localized orbitals. After you have result files for the optimized *D<sub>3h</sub>* and *D<sub>3d</sub>* structures, produce images of the molecules that display bond lengths and angles. Then produce images showing graphic representations of the unique local bonding orbitals (one C–C $\\sigma$-bond and one C–H $\\sigma$-bond will suffice). Report the energy difference for the two symmetries (syn and anti). Then present images for the bonding MOs for both symmetries. Compare their energies and their symmetries and discuss which best represent which local bonds (or combinations thereof.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now set the symmetry of the syn structure to *C<sub>1</sub>* (no symmetry – this will allow free bond rotation.) Run the optimization at the AM1 level? Is the result syn or anti. Discuss the result. If the result remains syn propose why GAMESS could not bring itself to start the bond rotation. Now change the torsion angle by 0.1˚. Run the optimization again. Discus the result. Compare the energies of the C1 anti and the C1 syn structures at the HF/6-311G(d,p)++ level. Compare bond lengths and angles as well. Do they match with the results that used symmetry? \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a ONE-PAGE document that presents the images of the molecules and local and molecular orbitals described above. Discuss the relative energies of the orbitals. Are there any degenerate sets? How many nodal planes are in each set? Can you see how the local orbitals could be combined to make the molecular orbitals?\n",
    "\n",
    "Did fixing the symmetry also fix the bond angles in the syn configuration? Present the consequences of removing the symmetry constraint. If there was no change in torsion when the symmetry was removed propose a reason why. Why did a slight tip in the torsion angle solve the problem? Present the bond lengths and angles for the HF/6-311G(d,p)++ and discuss how they relate to the values with symmetry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try running energy calculations at the HF/6-311G(d,p)++ level with and without symmetry and see if there is a difference in the time each calculation takes. Discuss the difference in time (there may be none as these are small molecules and modern personal computers are enormously powerful).\n",
