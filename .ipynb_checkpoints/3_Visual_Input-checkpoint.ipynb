    "# Methane: Visual Input and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "A hand crafted input file is a powerful thing. We can set it up exactly as we like. But there is another way. We can use various helper programs that enable the visual creation of a molecule and automatic generation of GAMESS input files. These files will often need further editing to get what you want out of GAMESS but, after we start using molecules larger than benzene, we will appreciate the computer (and curse it often).\n",
    "\n",
    "When interpreting the output file we can evaluate energies and bond lengths and angles easily. But visualization of the whole molecule will help see the relationships between distant atoms and also quickly identify structures that optimized to a nonsense answer. In addition, we can now interpret more mathematical aspects of the output like bond vibrations and mathematical surfaces that represent electron density and molecular orbital functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two applications that we will use are MacMolPlt and Avogadro. Both have different strengths and we will get to know them both. In this exercise, we will use MacMolPlt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will accomplish the following…\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tUse MacMolPlt to build molecules, generate input files and interpret results. \n",
    "2.\tUse GamessQ to submit jobs to GAMESS\n",
    "3.\tUse MacMolPlt to generate graphical images of the molecule and surfaces that represent electron density and molecular and local orbitals.\n",
    "4.\tIdentify the molecular orbitals that are most closely associated with the bonding local MOs and lone pair local MOs. How do you think about bonds and electronic structure? Do you think using local MOs that follow the Lewis structure or do you think using the molecular orbitals that describe the combined interactions of all atomic orbitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making Methane\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your copy of wxMacMolPlt and navigate to the build menu: `Builder` $\\rightarrow$ `Show Build Tools`. Select carbon with a coordination number of 4 and click in the empty window. Then select `Builder` $\\rightarrow$ `Add Hydrogens` to complete your structure of methane. Efforts to enforce symmetry on files created by MacMolPlt often fail and manual creation of files that use symmetry is preferred. GAMESS requires perfection when you are declaring symmetry. As a result, we will not use symmetry in this calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Select `Subwindow` $\\rightarrow$ `Input Builder` to start making an input file for GAMESS. In the `Basia` window select 6-311G for the basis set. Set “1” for `D and light atom polarization functions` (this is the “d,p” in the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.) Check the `Diffuse l-shell` and `s-shell` options (this is the “++” in 6-311G(d,p)++.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Control` window select `Run Type: Optimization` and also select `Localization Method: Edmiston-Ruedenberg`. The localization method will command GAMESS to write information into the output file that can be used to make local bonding molecular orbitals (we will be using them very soon in this exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Data` window make sure that the coordinate option is set to `Unique Cartesian`. Set the `symmetry point group` to *C<sub>1</sub>*. With *C<sub>1</sub>*, every atom will be unique as we are not declaring symmetry.\n",
    "In the `Misc Prefs` window set the MacMolPlt option. This will result in data written into the output file that helps MacMolPlt interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Stat. Point` window we can set the number of steps to a higher number that 20. We will use 20 for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the `Edit and Save` button and you will get a text window with the generated input file. You can make changes now or you can use a text editor later. Save the file. below is the file as saved by MacMolPlt.\n",

Watch as its status changes from pending to running to done. The output file will be in the directory specified in the GamessQ preference pane. Find it and open it in a text editor. Look quickly to the end of the file for the phrase “GAMESS TERMINATED NORMALLY”. If there was an error, trouble shoot the input file and try again. Find the “EQUILIBRIUM GEOMETRY LOCATED” statement and record the energy and check the new optimized coordinates for sanity.\n",

This would be a simple model that describes the electron pair for that bond (not really) and relates more directly to Lewis structure (if you prefer stick drawings to the truth of MATH.) In the `Subwindow` $\\rightarrow$ `Surfaces` window choose the 3D Orbital option and then choose the Localized Orbitals option from the Orbital Set menu.

    "## The Multiverse\n",
    "The $T_d$ symmetry enforces that the hydrogens are each in one of the octants of 3D space. This means that the cardinal planes are not through any of the hydrogen atoms. If you considered that the four hydrogens were each at corners of the cube then the planes are slicing through the faces of the cube. This is why all three of the degenerate orbitals are identical in appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your textbook may present different images of these orbitals. They are exactly the same orbitals, just with different placements of the cardinal planes w.r.t. the bonds. We used *C<sub>3v</sub>* symmetry for the ammonia molecule and, if we had used it with the methane Z-matrix that was created by modifying the ammonia Z-matrix, it would have worked just fine. The *C<sub>3v</sub>* symmetry requires that one of the four C–H bonds be along the $z$-axis. This means that two C–H bonds will be in a cardinal plane. The three degenerate orbitals all appear different because they each have a different relationship to the symmetry space. Despite this, they are identical. If orbitals have exactly the same energy then they are identical. The *C<sub>3v</sub>* arrangement is perhaps the most useful for interpreting a reaction. A hydrogen abstraction by a radical will occur by the radical approaching along a bond axis. Adding that element will reduce the symmetry to *C<sub>3v</sub>* from $T_d$. The molecular orbital that aligns with the $z$-axis best describes the frontier orbital that will guide the reaction as the atoms approach each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to use the *C<sub>2v</sub>* symmetry space. This will result in two separate pairs of C–H bonds being in cardinal planes. As a result two of the orbital images will appear identical with a third image being with a plane placed perpendicular to the other two. Again, it must be emphasized that all three degenerate molecular orbitals are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer the $T_d$ MO set since it does emphasize the idea that all three degenerate MOs are identical. (How many times have I said that already?) The *C<sub>3v</sub>* set is best for explaining frontier orbital interactions with an approaching radical, but I prefer using the idea of a local bonding C–H $\\sigma$-orbital when discussing a reaction with a C–H bond. Compare the local orbital with the $z$-axis MO and see how they are both great for discussing FMO theory.  The local orbital is far easier to use when we want to invoke the anti-bonding orbital that an approaching radical will actually be interacting with.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be exploring these ideas in the exercise supported by this discussion. Good luck.\n",

    "Use the result file with MacMolPlt to visualize the bonding molecular orbitals and the localized bonding orbitals. Are there degenerate sets in the molecular orbitals? Do any local orbitals resemble lone pairs? Do any of the MOs seem more closely related to lone pairs or more closely related to bonds? What are the relative energies of these MO sets and do the energies fit with expectations?\n",

    "Construct input files for methane using *C<sub>3v</sub>* and *C<sub>2v</sub>* symmetry and compare the shapes of these versions of the orbitals to those in ammonia and water. What similarities and differences do you observe?\n",

    "### The Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a ONE-PAGE document summarizing your results. Create images for each of the three molecules: methane, water, and ammonia. Include bond length and angles in the images. Create images of the molecules with the electron density surface colored by electrostatic potential. Discuss the reasons for different bond lengths and angles using VSEPR theory.\n",
