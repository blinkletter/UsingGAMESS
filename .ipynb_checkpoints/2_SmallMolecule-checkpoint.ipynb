    "# Water: Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we explore with computational chemistry? Let us explore the electronic structure of some small molecules. In this chapter we will learn ways to input molecules into GAMESS via input files. \n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will hopefully accomplish the following goals while learning new skills:\n",
    "-\tWe will confirm that your installation of GAMESS is working properly\n",
    "-\tWe will construct a GAMESS input file with a text editor.\n",
    "-\tWe will use three methods for creating a description of the atomic positions\n",
    "    -\tCartesian coordinates (classic xyz 3D space)\n",
    "    -\tUnique Cartesian with symmetry point groups\n",
    "    -\tInternal coordinates using a Z-matrix\n",
    "-\tWe will use GAMESS to determine the optimized structure of small molecules using semi-empirical methods. \n",
    "-\tWe will create new input files using the results of the previous calculation and calculate the optimized structure using more expensive methods.\n",
    "-\tWe will compare the methods that we try and choose a method for future work.\n",
    "-\tWe will humbly recognize that we are organic chemists and that we are using GAMESS as a recipe with poor understanding of the consequences of our choices. We will observe these consequences in our results as we move forward. If we knew what we were doing, we might avoid many inevitable pitfalls. However we have a whole box a band aids and always wear our safety goggles. Let’s go!\n",

    "## Small Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "Methane, ammonia and water: these three molecules are sp3 hybridized and should be tetrahedral in their VSEPR geometry. We expect to see bonds or lone pairs at angles of near 109&deg;\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate these molecules will need to describe a molecule for a computer. We will discuss two methods: Cartesian coordinates, where every atom is placed in 3D space with xyz values; unique Cartesian coordinates, where only atoms that are symmetry unique are placed and the rest are automatically generated to satisfy the symmetry point group; and the Z-matrix, where each atom is placed in space relative to the previous one in a carefully created list.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAMESS works by positioning the nuclei and then creating a mathematical function for the energy of the electrons. By taking the derivative of that function, GAMESS can determine if the current position is on a slope and then change the positions by a small amount to follow that slope downhill in energy. A new function is calculated and the process repeats again and again\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will be manually creating and running input files. In the future, we will learn how to use MacMolPlt and Avogadro to quickly build molecules and automatically create input files. But lets us first get our hands dirty before we start using power tools to do the hard work for us. Wax on, wax off!\n",

    "## Water\n",
    "\n",
    "Water has three atoms that have found an arrangement in space for the nuclei and electrons that is as low in energy as possible. Can we calculate that arrangement and see if it fits with observations? First, we must create a data set that describes the positions of the nuclei. Let us begin by discussing the nature of the 3D coordinate space used by GAMESS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 3D World\n",
    "\n",
    "x,y,z… That triplet describes the entire universe. But GAMESS does not treat x, y and z equally. Consider the axis diagram in {numref}`fig1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} images/GAMESS_AXES.png\n",

    "*The axis scheme for GAMESS atomic coordinates*\n",
    "```\n",
    "When constructing a structure using either Cartesian coordinates or a Z-matrix, we don’t consider any priority for an axis. However, when using point groups and symmetry to define molecules with unique Cartesian coordinates, we must pay attention to how GAMESS manipulates symmetry. The primary axis of the point group is expected to be the z-axis. Any vertical $\\sigma$-plane should first be set up in the zx plane. The horizontal $\\sigma$-plane should be considered to be the xy plane. The first perpendicular 2-fold axis should be set up along the x-axis. Keep these ideas in mind as we construct our first molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetry is beautiful. It also helps with math. If a molecule has symmetry, we should use it to make the calculations performed by GAMESS less expensive. A molecule that is known to possess 2-fold symmetry may be half as difficult to analyze because we may only need half the math. This depends a lot on the basis set chosen to describe the math of each atomic orbital but, most of the time, it is to our advantage to declare and use a symmetry point group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water has a *C<sub>2</sub>* axis. There is no perpendicular *C<sub>2</sub>* axis so we remain in the *C* group rather than rising to *D*. There is no $\\sigma_h$ but there are two $\\sigma_v$ planes. Therefore water is in the *C<sub>2v</sub>* point group. We will use Cartesian coordinates that place the primary axis along the z-axis and the atoms in the xz plane. See {numref}`fig2` for how we will position water in the 3D space used by GAMESS.\n",

    "### Building Water\n",
    "\n",
    "So how shall we build water? We can provide cartesian coordinates that position oxygen at the origin. Then we can position a hydrogen in on xz quadrant and the second hydrogen in the opposite quadrant. Compare the below set of coordinates to {numref}`fig2`.\n",

    "| Hydrogen | –b    | 0     | –a    |\n",
    "\n",
    "What values should we use for a and b? We know that the bond angle should be 104.5&deg; and that the bond length in water is 0.95 Å. We could use trigonometry and position the atoms accordingly. Or we could just throw some guess in and let GAMESS start there as it moves toward finding the optimal structure. I will set both a and b to 0.7 Å. Our initial guess at water will have a bond angle of 90&deg; and a bond length of $\\sqrt{(0.7+0.7)}$.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Your First Input File\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to create a text file that will be read into GAMESS to provide the information for the calculation. We must tell GAMESS what kind of calculation, the methods to use for determining energy, The conditions for declaring a satisfactory structure, and the data for the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the text file for this first GAMESS run. I created a file called water.inp and typed in the following text (feel free to cut and paste.)\n",

    "### The Structure of The Input File\n",
    "\n",
    "A GAMESS input file is a series of text lines called “cards.” (Before your parents were born, computers did not receive input via a keyboard, they used punched paper cards.) Each line must be less than 80 character (those paper cards were only so big.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is separated in a series a “groups.” Each group begins with a $ character and ends with a $END string. There are many, many groups available to the sophisticated theoretical chemist. We will only use a handful. In the water.inp file, we use the following groups: `$CONTRL`, `$SYSTEM`, `$BASIS`, `$STATPT` and `$DATA`. The `$` character for a group MUST be in the second column of a card (GAMESS is written in FORTRAN, an ancient computer language that is based on paper cards and therefore obsessive about columns in data input.) After several GAMESS jobs fail spectacularly on you, you will come to believe in this second column requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GAMESS groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick overview of the groups used in our first job. We will add to our skills as we move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \\$CONTRL Group\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$CONTRL` group establishes the kind of calculation. It can contain many parameters. The ones used here are our beginning set.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " $CONTRL SCFTYP=RHF RUNTYP=OPTIMIZE MAXIT=30 MULT=1 ICHARG=0 COORD=CART $END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Notes |\n",
    "| :---- | :---- |\n",
    "| `SCFTYP=RHF` | The method used is “restricted Hartee-Fock.” This assumes that all electrons are paired. |\n",
    "| `RUNTYP=OPTIMIZE` | The calculation is a structural optimization. |\n",
    "| `MAXIT=30` | The maximum number of iterations to determine the derivative of the function that describes everything about everything in the molecule. |\n",
    "| `MULT=1` | The spin multiplicity (1 means all electron spins are paired) |\n",
    "| `ICHARG=0` | The charge on the molecule |\n",
    "| `COORD=CART` | The coordinate system that we are using. We will use `CART` for describing the xyz of all atoms, `UNIQUE` for describing the xyz coordinates of atoms unique in the symmetry point group, and `ZMT` for internal coordinates in Z-matrix format. The very first run with `COORD=CART` will convert the xyz data into a symmetrical system aligned with the primary axis (we are already there) and with the origin at the center of mass of the molecule (we are definitely not there). The first result file will contain the unique symmetry coordinates for the molecule and we should use these new coordinates and `COORD=UNIQUE` for all subsequent calculations. |\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The `CART` coordinate option has been deprecated in modern versions of GAMESS. The new flag is `PRINAXIS`. `CART` will perform the job of `PRINAXIS`, but `CART` may someday be gone entirely. Both `CART` and `PRINAXIS` will reorient the molecule along the primary axis of the point group and generate a set of Cartesian coordinates for the symmetry unique atoms. You will only ever run a `CART` or `PRINAXIS` calculation once and thereafter will use the symmetry unique atoms and `COORD=UNIQUE` in all future calculations with your molecule.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \\$SYSTEM Group\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$SYSTEM` group defines parameters for the computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " $SYSTEM TIMLIM=525600 MEMORY=1000000 $END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Notes |\n",
    "| :---- | :---- |\n",
    "|`TIMLIM=525600` | The time limit for the calculation. 525,600 minutes – how do you measure a year in the life? |\n",
    "|`MEMORY=1000000` | The memory to be used (for each processor core.) Increase this if your job crashes out and complains about a lack of memory. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \\$BASIS Group\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$BASIS` group defines the theoretical rigor of the calculation. We will discuss this in more detail later. By using the AM1 level of theory we are declaring that we will use semi-empirical methods. This is a very low level calculation and requires little in computer resources. We will soon explore methods that will take some serious computer time (and time is money.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " $BASIS GBASIS=AM1 $END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \\$SCF Group\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$SCF` group is specific to the way the calculation is performed. The first derivative of the energy function is calculated and stored in a temporary file on disk. Later, when it is needed again, it is read from the disk (it is called several times in the calculation method.) Modern processors can actually recalculate this function from scratch faster than a computer hard disk can spin. The `DIRSCF=.TRUE.` command sets GAMESS to recalculate the function each time it is needed rather than read from the much slower disk drive (modern SSD storage may change this requirement – computers are improving all the time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " $SCF DIRSCF=.TRUE. $END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \\$STATPT Group\n",
    "\n",
    "The `$STATPT` group establishes the parameters for deciding when we have reached a “stationary point” where the derivative of the energy function is near zero (zero slope is likely the bottom of an energy well, the lowest point along the path that GAMESS has taken).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " $STATPT OPTTOL=0.0001 NSTEP=100 $END\n",
    "```\n",
    "| Parameter | Notes |\n",
    "| :---- | :---- |\n",
    "|`OPTTOL=0.0001` | If the RMS average of the energy gradients (slopes) for the whole system is less than this value then we declare that we are finished. |\n",
    "|`NSTEP=100` | The maximum number of steps that we take in the algorithm before we give up. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The \\$DATA Group\n",
    "\n",
    "The above groups instructed GAMESS how to treat the next group, the star of the show, the `$DATA` group. Let us now examine this importanjt part of the input file.\n",
    "```\n",
    " $DATA \n",

    "H     1.0   0.7   0.0  -0.7\n",
    " $END\n",
    " ```\n",
    "| Line | Notes |\n",
    "| :---- | :---- |\n",
    "| Line 1 | The first line in the `$DATA` group is the name of the job. Put whatever you want there. I chose water, it seemed appropriate. |\n",
    "| Line 2 | The next line is the symmetry point group. Water is *C<sub>2v</sub>*. GAMESS establishes this in two parts: first we declare *C<sub>nv</sub>* and then we set the value of $n$ as 2.|\n",
    "| Line 3 | The next line is blank. This is important. Leave it blank. (If we are not using symmetry, we will declare the point group to be *C<sub>1</sub>* and then the blank line will not be used.  Don’t worry, after a few crashed jobs you will get the hang of this.) |\n",
    "| Lines 4..n | All the following lines are the data for the nuclei. The first column is the name (it can be anything up to 10 characters), the next is the nuclear charge (this defines the atom), and then the x,y,z coordinates. Like all GAMESS groups, the `$DATA` group is ended by the `$END` string. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we defined `COORD=CART` in the `$CONTRL` group, GAMESS will input all the atomic coordinates and attempt to interpret them via the *C<sub>2v</sub>* point group. If your coordinates do not fit in that point group, the calculation will probably fail. If they fit the *C<sub>2v</sub>* group, then GAMESS will identify the symmetry and use only the unique atoms within the point group in the subsequent calculation. Defining the symmetry point group is very useful in minimizing the costs of a calculation.\n",

    "## Your First GAMESS Job\n",

HF theory attempts to describe the atomic orbitals using mathematical approximations but makes no simplifications (it does ignore electron correlation and the Restricted Hartree Fock method (RHF) that we will be using enforces that all electrons are paired in molecular orbitals. The math approximations that describe the atomic orbitals use Gaussian functions to model the atomic orbitals. Gaussians are far easier for a computer to calculate and adding many Gaussians together can get very close to the real answer. The more Gaussians and the more ways they are combined will give better accuracy but will also be more expensive in computer time.\n",

    "Although the Z-matrix will create a structure that looks a lot like ammonia, the three bond angles between H and N will not all be identical as the Z-matrix is converted to Cartesian coordinates. We defined the 3,1,2 and the 4,1,2 angles as 109.5&deg;, However we did not define the 4,1,3 bond angle. It will be the result of positioning the atoms according to the Z-matrix (1.0Å from the nitrogen, 109.5&deg; from the 2,1 bond and 120&deg; from the 1,2,3 plane. This should give us the correct structure. However, after the math is done that third 4,1,3 bond angle is not EXACTLY the same as the stated 4,1,2 and 3,1,2 angles. As a result, GAMESS could not determine the correct primary axis because the structure was not an exact fit to *C<sub>3v</sub>* symmetry.\n",

Recall the original Z-matrix for ammonia that we built above. We can use those coordinates for our current calculation. \n",

    "Write an input file for the tetrahedral methane molecule. Use the Td point group with a Z-matrix for the first attempt. Look to the ammonia Z-matrix with the dummy atom for inspiration. Run the job on your computer. If you are successful, you will have accomplished the first four of our learning goals. If it was not successful, try another way to build the molecule so that it fits $T_d$ symmetry. Perhaps a different construction of the Z-matrix or a set of cartesian coordinates would work. Errors are learning opportunities. Give yourself time to make lots of them.\n",

    "After you get it working, copy the coordinate data into higher level input files and optimize for HF/3-21G and HF/6-311(d,p)++ levels of theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the optimized Z-matrix (no dummy atoms were needed for methane) then you will have a Z-matrix in the results from which you can locate bond lengths and angles. If you prefer the unique coordinates you can set up a `$ZMAT` group to get those value directly from the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the bond lengths and angles for methane at the three levels of theory? Perform HF/6311(d,p)++ energy calculation using the optimized coordinates from the results for all three levels of theory. How do they compare. Which had the lowest energy (and was therefore the most accurate of the three structures)?\n",
