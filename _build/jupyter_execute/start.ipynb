    "# Introduction\n",
    "We have some intuition about chemical structure and energy. We know that butane is at its lowest energy in the *anti* conformation and that there is a small energy barrier to bond rotation due to steric clash. We know that the amide bond nitrogen is planar, rather than tetrahedral, and has a higher energy barrier to rotation due to its electronic structure. We can demonstrate these effects and explore consequences of changes in structure on our desktop using a computer and software that can calculate the energy of molecules. There are software packages that cost many thousands of dollars (per year!) and there are options that are free to all or free for academic use.\n",

    "***GAMESS***[^gamess1],[^gamess2],[^gamess_link]  is an ab initio computation package for investigating molecular structure and energy. There are others, such as ***NWChem*** [^nwchem],[^nwchem_link]  and ***ORCA*** [^orca],[^orca_link]. \n",
    "\n",
    "***MacMolPlt*** [^macmolplt],[^macmolplt_link]  is a graphical front end for *GAMESS*. It can build molecules, export input files and interpret the output files produced by GAMESS. ***Avogadro*** [^avogadro],[^avogadro_link]  is a more modern option but lacks some useful tools compared to MacMolPlt. There are others, such as ***Gabedit*** [^gabedit],[^gabedit_link]  and ***Molden***. [^molden],[^molden_link] \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use *GAMESS* and *MacMolPlt* together. We will also use *Avagadro*. \n",
